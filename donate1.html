                who work and volunteer at Chiara Home. There are very few places I can take my son Brenden for childcare. Chiara
                home is the one place, besides family, that I can trust to care for him"            <b>-Angela Indiana</b>

            <p>As more than 1 in 5 children have one or more emotional, behavioral, development or physical
                disability, it is clear that many families care for persons in their home with special needs
                . You probable know many families like this yourself. Chiara Home provides temporary out-of-home
                care to people of all ages with special needs. While caregivers go to work, attend to special obligations
                or take some well-deserved "me-time" (to refresh and recharge), they do so knowing their loved one is safe 
                and respected at Chiara Home. When you join the "Friends of Chiara Home" you make a pledge to help support these
                very special, loving families
